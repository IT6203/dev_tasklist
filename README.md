# tasklist website repo for source code
This repository will allow all team members to pull latest code from team members provided each memeber is commiting their changes regularly. Below is the project Description:

Scenario
Users within the CCSE community will have to register and fill out their profiles that include a list of
services they can provide to the community (Java Tutoring, SQL Tutoring, Basic PC Troubleshooting,
etc) and their availability (weekday morning, weekends, etc).
The idea is that members in the CCSE community can be both service providers and service requesters.
For instance, Student A has taken advance Java classes and feels confident with his/her Java skills and
would like to offer Java Tutoring to the CCSE community. On the registration page, Student A will fill
out his/her profile and select Java Tutoring as one of the services that he/she can provide.
However, one day, Student A’s computer broke down and he/she would like to find someone who can
help him/her fixing the computer. After logging into the website, Student A will do a search and find
out that Student B can provide Computer Repair service. Student A will then create a New Task to
request a service for Computer Repair and select Student B as the service provider.

Features
Users who are not registered and logged in to the application can:
• Register and fill out their profile, which include a list of services that they can provide and a list
of date/time that they can provide the services.
• Search services offered by the registered users.
Users who are registered and logged in to the application can:
• Create new tasks and assign them to other users;
• Transfer tasks from their accounts to other user accounts;
• Mark the tasks assigned to them as completed and remove them from the list;
• Receive notification when a new task is assigned to them;
• Search services offered by other users.

Features
For this project, you will plan, design and develop a multi-tier web application. You can use one of the
individual projects as a starting point. I expect one main page with:
• Login form
• Description of your site
• Names of the site administrators (team members)
• Menu

The list of features to add:
1. Authentication
2. After logging in, a registered user should be able to:
a. Modify their profiles.
b. Transfer tasks assigned to them to other users who offer the same service;
c. Mark completed tasks as completed and remove them from the list (task requester
should receive notification email that task is completed);
d. A page to create new task requesting service from other users. The New Task page
should include at least the following information:
i. KSU NetID of the requesting user;
ii. Service requested;
iii. Task description;
iv. Task deadline;
v. The user who are selected/assigned to complete the task.
e. A page to display user information and all tasks assigned to the user;
f. When a new task is assigned to a user, that user is notified via email.
In your projects you will use at least
• HTML
• CSS
• JavaScript
• PHP
• MySQL
• LDAP authentication
• Ajax
